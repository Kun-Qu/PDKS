PDKS is a LBM solver for 2D inviscid/laminar compressible flow. It was developed by Dr. QU Kun during
his PhD study in National University of Singapore.

PDKS is a simple research code, it surport
1 2D Plot3D grid
2 several LB models for compressible flows by QU
3 MPI parallel computing by splitting the domain along I direction
4 input file format based on http://www.math.tu-cottbus.de/~berti/gral 中的control-device
5 tecplot output
